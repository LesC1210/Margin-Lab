In the spring of my Freshman year, I took a class called Affective Computing.  This course led me to learn more about the field of Human Computer Interaction.  I love how interdisciplinary and flexible HCI is.  It allows people to make direct impact to various communities through technology.  After graduation in 2021, I would love to pursue a masters degree in HCI. I want to research how HCI can impact specifically underrepresented communities such as African-Americans and women.  After spending time in research and industry,  I would like to pursue a PhD in Computer Science!  Not only is there an issue of diversity in industry, but there is also a huge lack of representation in academia.  I would like to one day be encouragement for students that look like me to pursue their wildest STEM dreams regardless of statistics.
When I am not partaking in activities related to my education, I am volunteering in my home community or the community surrounding Howard.  Community service is very important to me. I believe if someone took the time to pour knowledge, skills, etc into you, you should also pay that generosity forward.  I enjoy working with students from both of these community especially when it is related to Computer Science or STEM.   Considering I didnâ€™t have many STEM related opportunities growing up, it is important to me that I am exposing this area of STEM, and others, to students while they are young!
