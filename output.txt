                  In the spring of my Freshman year, I took a class called      
                   Affective Computing.  This course led me to learn more       
                  about the field of Human Computer Interaction.  I love h      
                  ow interdisciplinary and flexible HCI is.  It allows peo      
                  ple to make direct impact to various communities through      
                   technology.  After graduation in 2021, I would love to       
                  pursue a masters degree in HCI. I want to research how H      
                  CI can impact specifically underrepresented communities       
                  such as African-Americans and women.  After spending tim      
                  e in research and industry,  I would like to pursue a Ph      
                  D in Computer Science!  Not only is there an issue of di      
                  versity in industry, but there is also a huge lack of re      
                  presentation in academia.  I would like to one day be en      
                  couragement for students that look like me to pursue the      
                  ir wildest STEM dreams regardless of statistics.
      
                  When I am not partaking in activities related to my educ      
                  ation, I am volunteering in my home community or the com      
                  munity surrounding Howard.  Community service is very im      
                  portant to me. I believe if someone took the time to pou      
                  r knowledge, skills, etc into you, you should also pay t      
                  hat generosity forward.  I enjoy working with students f      
                  rom both of these community especially when it is relate      
                  d to Computer Science or STEM.   Considering I didnâ€™t       
                  have many STEM related opportunities growing up, it is i      
                  mportant to me that I am exposing this area of STEM, and      
                   others, to students while they are young!
